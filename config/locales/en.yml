    about:
      background: "Background"
      background_text: "Our first child was born in July 2011. During her first
months we were almost obsessed with her sleep, mainly because her sleep also
controlled ours. I tried out several baby tracker apps and found them too
advanced and focused on timing the infant like with a stop-watch. That was not
ideal for us."
      background_text_2: "For instance, when a baby wants to eat (breastfed 
or bottlefed) the parent’s main focus is on feeding, not on starting a timer. 
Same thing with sleep. We ended up writing down the times our daughter fell 
asleep and woke up on paper, summing the hours and minutes every morning. 
We actually found that easier than using a baby tracker app – because the apps 
were too advanced."
